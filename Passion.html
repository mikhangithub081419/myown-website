<h1>PASSION OF LIFE</h1>
<ul>
<h2><center>I like to serve every week. I also like share things that happen in my life with my close friends and my boyfriend. But when I can't share it with the close people in my life, I just say it to God. Yes, I shared my problem with God. Because no one will judge you and no one will make side comments.</h2>
<h2><center>But the only passion in my life is to reach my dream for my life and my family. But here I am today, continuing to fight and will fight for my dream in my life for my family and my future.</h2>
<h2><center>So my future is good for my own family and my family. Because there's nothing wrong with dreaming as long as you have a dream for your loved ones and yourself. Because I know God is only there to guide and help us fight for our dreams in our lives.</h2>
<h2><center>That is my passion in my life to fight for the dream for the future and life.</h2>
