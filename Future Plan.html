<h1>MY FUTURE PLAN</h1>
<h2>My future plan is to help people in need. Especially my family, the people around me, people on the streets. But before all that, I will finish my studies and look for a good job.</h2>
<h2>When I accomplish that I can help them. I will lift my family out of poverty. Then when I do that, I can fulfill all my wishes, my family's wishes. And of course I can't forget the people who helped me from the beginning and God who guided me and made me strong.</h2>
<h2>And of course to my family and my boyfriend who support me tirelessly. To my boyfriend who served as my diary and my support, my advisor for my tasks and problems. And then I will continue to fulfill my dreams in my life without getting bored and without getting tired.</h2>
