<h2>The journey of my life is like a rainbow in the sky. Because a lot has happened since I was a child until now in my present there is and there is color and light that will shine in my life that will give me a weapon for my continued fight in my life.
<h2>I started when I started serving in our church when I was 10 years old.
I served because my parents and grandmother raised me with the fear of God. I experienced a lot it until it came to the point that I got kidney disease. I went back and forth to the hospital until I asked God why are you torturing me like this? Then I realized that he gave me such a test so that I could strengthen my faith in him even more. That's when I began to trust God more and strengthen my heart.</h2>

<h2>I had a hard time adjusting when I went to Senior High because I was home schooled for 1 year because my disease meant that I was not allowed to socialize with many people and I was not allowed to get infected. But I fought for my dream and I got strength from my family and God, so I graduated from senior high school and got a conducting award.</h2>

<h2>When I went to college, I met my boyfriend there. He has been my partner, brother, friend, father, advisor, just what is called an all in one partner or partner in crime. We both went through a lot but we still fought.</h2>

<h2>Then we got together a group of friends called TROOPS. They are with us from assignments to projects. Teasing and eating. It even got to the point that if one doesn't or won't go, everyone won't go either.</h2>

<h2>So I completed a 3 year course with them. And I continued to study Bachelor Degree for 1 year. It's sad that I can't study with them now, but I know I can help them when they study again.</h2>
